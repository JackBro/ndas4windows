        the broadcast address.

Return Value:

Routine Description:

    This routine opens a file that points to an existing address object, or, if
    the object doesn't exist, creates it (note that creation of the address
    object includes registering the address, and may take many seconds to
    complete, depending upon system configuration).

    If the address already exists, and it has an ACL associated with it, the
    ACL is checked for access rights before allowing creation of the address.

Arguments:

    DeviceObject - pointer to the device object describing the LPX transport.

    Irp - a pointer to the Irp used for the creation of the address.

    IrpSp - a pointer to the Irp stack location.

Return Value:

    NTSTATUS - status of operation.

Routine Description:

    This routine destroys a transport address and removes all references
    made by it to other objects in the transport.  The address structure
    is returned to nonpaged system pool or our lookaside list. It is assumed
    that the caller has already removed all addressfile structures associated
    with this address.

    The routine is called from a worker thread so that the security
    descriptor can be accessed.

    This worked thread is only queued by LpxDerefAddress.  The reason
    for this is that there may be multiple streams of execution which are
    simultaneously referencing the same address object, and it should
    not be deleted out from under an interested stream of execution.

Arguments:

    Address - Pointer to a transport address structure to be destroyed.

Return Value:

Routine Description:

    This routine is called to terminate all activity on an AddressFile and
    destroy the object.  We remove every connection and datagram associated
    with this addressfile from the address database and terminate their
    activity. Then, if there are no other outstanding addressfiles open on
    this address, the address will go away.

Arguments:

    AddressFile - pointer to the addressFile to be stopped

    Address - the owning address for this addressFile (we do not depend upon
        the pointer in the addressFile because we want this routine to be safe)

Return Value:

    STATUS_SUCCESS if all is well, STATUS_INVALID_HANDLE if the Irp does not
    point to a real address.
