NDAS Events

NDAS Service generates events through the read-only named pipe 
(\\.\pipe\ndas\event). Clients can dispatch events from service
reading this pipe.

When a client connects this event pipe, the initial message
is sent to the pipe from the service, which shows the version
of the event publisher.
