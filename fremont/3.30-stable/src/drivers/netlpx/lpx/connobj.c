This module contains code which implements the TP_CONNECTION object.
Routines are provided to create, destroy, reference, and dereference,
transport connection objects.

A word about connection reference counts:

With TDI version 2, connections live on even after they have been stopped.
This necessitated changing the way LPX handles connection reference counts,
making the stopping of a connection only another way station in the life
of a connection, rather than its demise. Reference counts now work like
this:

Connection State         Reference Count     Flags
------------------       -----------------   --------
Opened, no activity             1              0
Open, Associated                2            FLAGS2_ASSOCIATED
Open, Assoc., Connected         3            FLAGS_READY
 Above + activity              >3            varies
Open, Assoc., Stopping         >3            FLAGS_STOPPING
Open, Assoc., Stopped           3            FLAGS_STOPPING
Open, Disassoc. Complete        2            FLAGS_STOPPING
                                             FLAGS2_ASSOCIATED == 0
Closing                         1            FLAGS2_CLOSING
Closed                          0            FLAGS2_CLOSING

Note that keeping the stopping flag set when the connection has fully
stopped avoids using the connection until it is connected again; the
CLOSING flag serves the same purpose. This allows a connection to run
down in its own time.

Routine Description:

    This routine destroys a transport connection and removes all references
    made by it to other objects in the transport.  The connection structure
    is returned to our lookaside list.  It is assumed that the caller
    has removed all IRPs from the connections's queues first.

    This routine is only called by LpxDereferenceConnection.  The reason for
    this is that there may be multiple streams of execution which are
    simultaneously referencing the same connection object, and it should
    not be deleted out from under an interested stream of execution.

Arguments:

    TransportConnection - Pointer to a transport connection structure to
        be destroyed.

Return Value:

    NTSTATUS - status of operation.
