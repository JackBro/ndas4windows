The original NetDisk software was branched into NDAS in Mayfield.
Mayfield was branched twice, first to Freemont, then to Chagrin. 

Netdisk
|
Mayfield (from Netdisk to NDAS 3.12)
| 
| - Freemont to NDAS 3.50
| Branches in this repo go up to NDAS 3.50.
| Higher versions were released, but those are not
| available in this Open Source release.
|
| - Chagrin (NDAS 4.0) was never released. It was a
| branched to create a different algorithm for 
| multiple write access. The role of access controller
| would be more flexible and I/O would be managed by
| need, rather than by a single host at all times.
