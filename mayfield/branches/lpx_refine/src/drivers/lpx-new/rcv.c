Routine Description:

    This routine is called by the I/O system to cancel a receive
    datagram. The receive is looked for on the address file's
    receive datagram queue; if it is found it is cancelled.

    NOTE: This routine is called with the CancelSpinLock held and
    is responsible for releasing it.

Arguments:

    DeviceObject - Pointer to the device object for this driver.

    Irp - Pointer to the request packet representing the I/O request.

Return Value:

    none.
