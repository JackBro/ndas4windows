/*
                An implementation of top-down splaying
                    D. Sleator <sleator@cs.cmu.edu>
    	                     March 1992

  "Splay trees", or "self-adjusting search trees" are a simple and
  efficient data structure for storing an ordered set.  The data
  structure consists of a binary tree, without parent pointers, and no
  additional fields.  It allows searching, insertion, deletion,
  deletemin, deletemax, splitting, joining, and many other operations,
  all with amortized logarithmic performance.  Since the trees adapt to
  the sequence of requests, their performance on real access patterns is
  typically even better.  Splay trees are described in a number of texts
  and papers [1,2,3,4,5].

  The code here is adapted from simple top-down splay, at the bottom of
  page 669 of [3].  It can be obtained via anonymous ftp from
  spade.pc.cs.cmu.edu in directory /usr/sleator/public.

  The chief modification here is that the splay operation works even if the
  item being splayed is not in the tree, and even if the tree root of the
  tree is NULL.  So the line:

                              t = splay(i, t);

  causes it to search for item with key i in the tree rooted at t.  If it's
  there, it is splayed to the root.  If it isn't there, then the node put
  at the root is the last one before NULL that would have been reached in a
  normal binary search for i.  (It's a neighbor of i in the tree.)  This
  allows many other operations to be easily implemented, as shown below.
