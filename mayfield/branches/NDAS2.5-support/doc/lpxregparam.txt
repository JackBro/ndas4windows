Create DWORD value in lpx key(folder)

Value: ConnectionTimeout
Data: Timeout when connecting (default: 2000ms)

Value: SmpTimeout
Data: Set time-interval that checks retransmission & all timeouts (default: 50ms)

Value: WaitInterval
Data: Time to wait after TIME_WAIT state(default: 1000ms)

Value: AliveInterval
Data: Interval to check alive(default: 1000ms)

Value: RetransmitDelay
Data: Retransmis packet again if ACK is not received for this time.(default: 200ms)

Value: MaxRetransmitDelay
Data: RetransmitDelay is doubled after each retransmit, but is limited by this value.(default: 1000ms)

Value: MaxAliveCount
Data: Disconnect after MaxAliveCount's alive-packet miss. So connection time-out is MaxAliveCount * AliveInterval. (default: 8)

Value: MaxRetransmitTime
Data: Try retransmit for this time and it still fails, discoonect. (default: 8000ms)

Value: MTU
Data: Maximum transfer unit including LPX header and LPX data payload.Value 0 means unlimited.(default:1500). Set this to 0 or larger value to support jumbo packet
