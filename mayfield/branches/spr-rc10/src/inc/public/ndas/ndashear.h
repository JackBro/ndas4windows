/* 
   Summary
   The %SYMBOLNAME% function initiates use of NDASHEAR.DLL or
   NDASHEAR.LIB by a process.
   
   Description
   The NdasHeartbeatInitialize function must be the first NdasHeartbeat
   function called by an application or DLL. It initializes internal
   data structures and underlying operating system services.

   An application must call one NdasHeartbeatUninitialize call for
   every successful NdasHearbeatInitialize call. This means, for example,
   that if an application calls NdasHeartbeatInitialize twice, it must call
   NdasHeartbeatUninitialize twice. 

   Returns
   If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero.
   If the function fails, the return value is zero. 
   To get extended error information, call GetLastError.

   Summary

   Description
   An application or DLL is required to perform a successful 
   NdasHeartbeatInitialize call before it can use other NdasHeartbeat API
   calls. When it has completed the use of NdasHeartbeat API, 
   the application or DLL must call NdasHeartbeatUninitialize to
   deregister itself from a NdasHeartbeat API implementation and
   allow the implementation to free any resources allocated on behalf of
   the application or DLL.
   
   Before cleaning up NdasHeartbeat API, be sure to clean up all registered 
   handles, or some resources may leak.

/* 
   Summary
   The %SYMBOLNAME% registers a callback .
   
   Description
   Application can use the %SYMBOLNAME% function to register to receive
   NDAS device heartbeat notification.

   It is limited to a single process to use this function.
   In a process, you can register multiple callbacks.
   If any other process is using this function, no notification will be sent,
   including NDAS service. It means that if an application registers 
   a callback function, NDAS service will be disrupted.
   No error messages will be generated in case of this conflict at this time.

   Notification handles returned by %SYMBOLNAME% must be closed by calling 
   the NdasHeartbeatUnregisterNotification function when they are no longer 
   needed.

   Parameters
   %PAR0% :  [in] Specifies the callback function that will be 
             executed when a NDAS heartbeat packet is arrived.
   %PAR1% :  [in] Pointer to an application-defined context block.
             For each call to the callback function, this will be supplied.

   Returns
   If the function succeeds, the return value is a handle to the registered
   callback function. You can get
