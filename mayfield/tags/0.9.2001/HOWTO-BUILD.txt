AT BUILD MACHINE ONLY

 PRODUCTVER.TXT contains the version of the software.
 This version file can be used to synchronize with file following files
 using "setver.cmd":

 - \lanscsisystemv2\src\inc\prodver.h
 - \installer\NetDiskSetup.ism
 - \oem\<vendor>\installer\NetDiskSetup.ism

 * From InstallShield 9.0, we no longer maintain separate isv and ism file.

RETAIL BUILD
=====================================================================

1. Compile the source
  
  From cmd.exe, run the buildsrc.cmd for entire source tree

  	run \buildsrc.cmd retail

2. InstallShield Setup

  2.1. Synchronize the files from the source tree

	run \installer\sync2src.cmd


2.3. Build individual releases

  2.3.1 US Release

	run \installer\buildsetup_us.cmd

  2.3.2 International Release (European)

	run \installer\buildsetup_intl.cmd

  2.3.3 Japan Release

	run \installer\buildsetup_japan.cmd



3. Example

 c:\workspace> buildsrc retail
 ...(working)...
 ...(working)... it takes about 3 minutes
 ...(working)...

 c:\workspace> cd installer

 c:\workspace\installer> sync2src.cmd
 ...(working)...

 c:\workspace\installer> buildsetup_us.cmd
 ...(working)...

 Now you get the distribution files at "c:\workspace\dist\US\*"

=====================================================================
